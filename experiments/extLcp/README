Note:

BCR can compute at the same time:
- the (extended) Burrows–Wheeler transform (multi-string BWT)
- the generalize suffix array  (optional)
- the longest common prefix array (optional)
of a very large collection of strings having different or same length. 


One can set the parameters in Tools.h

The output format can be:
- EGSA (OUTPUT_FORMAT_EGSA must be 1). The end-marker in .bwt file is the symbol '\0'
- three files: .bwt, .lcp, .pairSA, (OUTPUT_FORMAT_EGSA must be 0). The end-marker in .bwt file is the symbol '#'
